Real-time deepfake detection solution for web environments.

## What is LunarByte?

LunarByte analyzes video streams within web browsers to detect deepfake content in real-time. This open-source project provides accessible deepfake detection capabilities directly in the browser environment without requiring external servers or cloud services.

The project addresses the growing concern of manipulated media content by offering a privacy-focused solution that processes video data locally on the user's device. Whether implemented as a browser extension or web application, LunarByte aims to help users identify potentially synthetic video content across various online platforms.

## Core Features

The system provides real-time video stream analysis from webcams, video elements, and streaming content using AI-powered deepfake detection through machine learning models. Browser extension support covers major browsers while a web application interface offers direct usage without installation requirements.

**Privacy remains central to the design** - all video processing occurs locally on the user's device with no data transmission to external servers. The open-source codebase ensures full transparency in how the detection algorithms operate.

## Technical Implementation

The frontend utilizes JavaScript for core functionality, WebRTC for real-time video stream handling, Canvas API for video frame processing, and Web Extensions API for browser integration. Machine learning components rely on TensorFlow.js for in-browser model execution and OpenCV.js for computer vision processing with pre-trained deepfake detection models.

Development infrastructure includes Webpack for bundling and optimization, ESLint for code quality maintenance, Jest for testing, and GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

## Getting Started

Prerequisites include Node.js version 16 or higher, npm or yarn package manager, and a modern web browser supporting Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LunarByte.git
cd LunarByte

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

For browser extension setup, build the extension and load it into your browser.

```bash
# Build extension
npm run build:extension
```

Navigate to your browser's extensions page (chrome://extensions/), enable developer mode, and load the unpacked extension from the dist folder.

For web application usage, start the server and access it through your browser.

```bash
# Start web application
npm run serve

# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

## Project Structure and Development

The codebase organizes into src/extension for browser extension code, src/webapp for web application code, src/models for ML model files, src/utils for utility functions, and src/components for reusable UI components. Additional directories include tests for testing files, docs for documentation, and build for build configuration.

**Contributing follows standard open-source practices** with issue tracking, feature branching using descriptive names like `feature/your-feature-name` or `fix/issue-description`, code style adherence, test coverage for new functionality, and clear pull request descriptions.

## Detection Methodology

The current implementation combines facial landmark analysis for face manipulation detection, temporal consistency analysis for video authenticity verification, and ensemble learning approaches for improved accuracy across different types of synthetic content.

Performance considerations include processing optimization for real-time performance, minimized memory usage for browser environments, configurable quality versus speed trade-offs, and efficient model loading and caching mechanisms.

## Development Roadmap

The current phase focuses on basic deepfake detection implementation, Chrome extension development, and core web application features. The next phase will introduce Firefox extension support, improved detection accuracy, and performance optimizations.

Future plans include audio deepfake detection capabilities, mobile browser support, API service development for third-party integration, and advanced reporting features for detailed analysis results.

## License and Support

This project operates under the MIT License, providing broad permissions for use, modification, and distribution. Support channels include GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests, GitHub Discussions for community conversation, and direct contact through issue creation for questions or feedback.

The project builds upon research and tools from the computer vision and deepfake detection community, acknowledging contributions from researchers and developers working on media authenticity and digital forensics.

**This tool serves as a supplementary verification method for deepfake detection**. Results should be considered alongside other verification approaches when making important decisions about media authenticity.
